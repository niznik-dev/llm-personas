"""Build shipped persona files from a role harness + a character overlay.

Each persona is authored as two sources, so the role mechanism lives in
exactly one place and the backstory simply *expands* it:

  - roles/<codename>.md           the bland, reusable "harness" (the role)
  - personas/<name>/character.md   the character that expands that role

The character file contains one or more markers of the form:

    <!-- ROLE:<codename> -->

Each marker is replaced by the *injectable* block of roles/<codename>.md —
the text fenced between <!-- INJECT:start --> and <!-- INJECT:end -->. The
material outside that fence (the role's standalone intro and invocation
notes) is for using the harness on its own and is not spliced in.

Output: personas/<name>/<name>.md  (generated — do not edit by hand)
